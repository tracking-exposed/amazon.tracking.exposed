amazon.tracking.exposed started because of a collaboration between [Claudio Agosti](https://linktr.ee/claudio.agosti) 
and the RAI, the Italian state TV, in summer 2019. Has been produced free sofrware (on [github](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/amtrex)) and an investigation. The tool was necessary to offer new perspecives in [documentary about Amazon](https://www.rai.it/ufficiostampa/assets/template/us-articolo.html?ssiPath=/articoli/2019/12/Petrolio-ed126ca7-42a3-4752-a727-a6eeb1176895-ssi.html). After th media publicartion, it become part of the Tracking Exposed pipeline, used by students and researchers to study Amazon's personalization algorithms.

The tool consisted in a **browser extension**, a **backend to process the scraped evidences**, and this website to return the metadata produced as CSV, to let researcher complete the analysis with external tools. The extension and the backend stop to be maintained in 2021, hencefort this tool should be discontinued because meanwhile Amazon has update its web structure and we didn't update our scraping mechanism.

Below you can find the three episode where the tool was effective to inspect Amazon inernal logics:

[Warehouse of information: Amazon's data collection practices and their relation to GDPR](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/presentation/blob/master/Dimitri%20Koehorst%20Master%20Thesis%20Final%20Version.pdf)

_Dimitri Koehorst - Universiry of Amsterdam master thesis_

In recent times, data has become increasingly central to a variety of different companies. While the use of data has become widespread, there are some companies whose entire business model revolves around the use of data. One  such company is Amazon. Initially it was merely an online bookstore, but as the company grew it incorporated multiple new branches, such as Amazon Web Services, which allow the company to collect data from a variety of different sources. C ompanies such as Amazon use this data to optimize their services, which allows them to gain certain advantages over their competitors. However, this usage of data is bound by international regulations, one of which is the GDPR, the new data  protection legislation of the European Union. By using data collected from the Amazon.com webstore as a case study, this thesis investigates the shift of companies towards a data-oriented business model, and investigates certain problems t hat this shift brings. This is done through the research question: How can we conceptualize the data collection practices of Amazon in relation to the General Data Protection Regulation?
