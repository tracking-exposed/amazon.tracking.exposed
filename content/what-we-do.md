You should install the browser extension. It passively scrape: **search query results**, and **product page**.

The researcher might try to repeat the same searches with difgerent variables (profile logged or not, same ip, same postal code, browser language, clean cookies, etc)

The extension gives access to the personal page, and **with APIs you can download aggregated data in CSV and JSON** format. There are also public APIs to download, for example, all the search queries.

The browser extension do not keep track of any personal data related to the profile, therefore, the method of content selection is mandatory to interpret the personalization. Documentation is it still a work in progress! Please reach out to support at tracking dot exposed.
