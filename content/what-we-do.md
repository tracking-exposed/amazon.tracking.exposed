<div style="font-size:1.9em">


— We develop a tool for independent third-party analysis; In this site, we talk about about the Amazon shopping portal ( <a href="https://tracking.exposed">but that's more</a>).
<br>
— We contest algorithms logic, as we don't believe the corporate PR stunts.
<br>
— We infer privacy violations, as personalization is an effect of profiling, regulated under GDPR.
<br>
— We complain to data protection authorities
<br>
— We promote this method to be open source and usable by anyone willing to learn it.
